This project was done to learn the use of rrweb for saving users session replay. 
Users session replay means that it record what user interacted with in your site from start to end store it in a json form.
It also uses websocket to implement live streaming of the sessions. 
For eg. If you want to look at what your user is interacting with you can live stream it.
You can also replay a saved session by choosing the session ID.
